# thebigCO2project
This is my year 13, NCEA Level 3 project in school. The Big CO2 Project is a website created with intention to inform others about the dangers of excessive CO2 and also displays the CO2 levels of different classrooms in St Hilda's Collegiate School and Kings High School. This project was created in collaboration with Otago Polytechnic.
